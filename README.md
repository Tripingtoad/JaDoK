# JaDoK Cultured

## Introduction
JaDoK Cultured is a strategic card game where players compete to gain victory points through tactical play of cards and smart management of resources.

## Setup
- Each player starts with a shuffled deck of cards (Just a Deck of Kards).
- Players draw 10 cards to their hand and 10 cards to place face down in their wall zone.
- The 1st player token, symbolizing initiative, is randomly given at the start.

## Round Sequence
Players complete each step of the round sequence simultaneously:
1. **Action Points & Draw Cards**: Restore action points for character cards. Players with the 1st player token may draw a card.
2. **Action Sequence Pile (ASP)**: Players add cards to the ASP or place the 1st player token on it. Cards in the ASP resolve in a first-in-last-out order.
3. **Move and Melee Combat**: Players may move characters and perform melee actions.
4. **Ranged Combat**: Execute ranged combat actions.
5. **Refortify**: Perform additional actions using leftover action points.

## Specific Rules
- 10 cards can only be played during the refortify phase or from the ASP.
- ASP cards can be discarded or placed in the wall zone.
- Armor cards are played from hand as armor blocks.
- #5s block damage from specific cards.
- Queen of diamonds and Queen of hearts have unique blocking abilities.
- Jacks cannot perform melee damage actions.
- Kings increase damage when used as weapons.
- The Death knight's destroy ability is triggered under specific conditions.
- Aces and magic blocks can prevent certain damages and traps.

## Blocking and Drawing
- Only one block of each type (armor or magical) can be used when dealing damage.
- Players may skip drawing a card.

## Jokers and Statistics
- Characters can use action points for Joker damage actions.
- Players have access to game statistics but cannot view certain hidden elements.

## Spending Points Between Rounds
- Players not leading in points can spend points to view or reshuffle their wall cards.

## Winning the Game
- Matches continue until a player reaches 50 or more Victory points.
- Points are awarded for characters in zones and face-down traps in walls.
- The player with the most points at the end of a match wins.

## Match End Conditions
- If a player has no character cards in any zone and no face-down traps, the match ends.
- The match also ends if a player's deck is empty, or they have no cards in all zones.

## Restarting a Game
- If there is no winner at the end of a game, a new game begins.
- The player with the least points starts with the 1st player token.
